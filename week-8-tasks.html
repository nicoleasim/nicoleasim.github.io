		Task 1: Analyse Audio
		</h3>
	<h4>

	</h4>
	<ul>
	<li><i>What types of audio is used?</li></i>
	<dd>- The audio features sound effects, background music and speech. For example, the scene at the harbour has background music however you can also hear sounds of birds and of the sea, typical harbour sounds which you would hear if you were there. The piano music however is there to create the ambience and is something you would not hear if you were physically there.
	</dd>
	<dd>- Speech is spoken by Celine Bernaert and Michele Morone, both of whom are makeup artists. Their speech is used when the user clicks on a product, and they explain its use.
	</dd>
	<li><i>Is there evidence of intent?
	</li></i>
	<dd>- The entire virtual reality is designed to appeal and retain the attention of users. They have developed something that makes the user feel like they are involved and immerses them into the products.
	</dd>
	<dd>- It is described as a 'memorable digital experience'.
	</dd>
	<li><i>What are the advantages and caveats?
	</li></i>
	<dd>- The use of audio has been used to convey meaning and experience for the user. Dolce & Gabbana want the user to feel like they are on the island of Capri themselves and want the user to feel the culture they have associated with these products. This is evident in the feature when you can tap an instrument that is native to Capri and hear how it sounds. Although this has nothing to do with makeup, they want the use to feel immersed in the culture within this digital experience.
	</dd>
	<dd>- There are multiple sounds used which could be seen as a caveat. As there is so much going on with the visual, textual and sound, it may be overwhelming for some. As audio is not as memorable, it may not entice people to buy the products. From first-hand experience, I have gone through the virtual experience multiple times and could not explain what some of the products were but could describe the visual aspects.
