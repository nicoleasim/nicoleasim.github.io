		Task 1: Identifying a Topic
		</h3>
		<p>The independent learning tasks allowed us to think about topics and research what we wanted to focus on. Initially, I had considered a topic surrounding AI, and how influential it can be for decision making in business, however I found that the subject of AI is so broad that it would be difficult for me to get so specific. Being able to discuss this with my tutor and classmates in the labs allowed me to consider and hear other ideas. After looking over material from 1st and 2nd year, I settled on the topic of gaming in educational settings. Below are my notes from this task:
		<br>
		<br><b>Why video games are essential in improving student engagement in educational settings</b><br>
		<ul>
		<li><i>Who would benefit from engaging with this topic?</i></li>
		<dd>- Teachers and educators so they can improve/implement new teaching methods</dd>
		<dd>- Parents, who may have assumptions about video games that relate to stereotypes</dd>
		<li><i>Are the envisioned audience acquainted with some aspects of the topic?</i></li>
		<dd>- Yes, the use of digital resources is encouraged in the Scottish education system by the Scottish Government.</dd>
		<li><i>Will you have to persuade them that this is worth learning?</i></li>
		<dd>- Initially maybe, depending on the person. I feel that older teachers may not be as open to this as younger ones, however that could be a stereotype that I am feeding into about older people being resistant to technology.</dd>
		</ul>
		<p>After considering this, I realised I need to narrow down my topic further. I narrowed it down to the use of video games in humanaties education. I had considered STEM subjects, but as I have a limited knowledge of this I chose to make my focus on the humanaties.</P>

		Task 2: Reseach Sources</h3>
		<p>My first source was Google Scholar during my research. I started with a basic search of 'video games used in education', and 'digital resources in education'. The next refinment was '"video games" "student engagement" "education".
		</p>
		<p><b>Search Term Evaluation</p></b>
		<ul>
		<li><i>'video games' 'cultural heritage' 'education'</li></i>
		<dd>- This search term returned useful sources for me regarding the use of video games in cultural heritage education, for example it gave me articles about how they can maximise engagement in education which is useful for my audience.</b>
		</ul>
