		<h2>IL Tasks</h2>
		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<p>The independent learning tasks allowed us to think about topics and research what we wanted to focus on. Initially, I had considered a topic surrounding AI, and how influential it can be for decision making in business, however I found that the subject of AI is so broad that it would be difficult for me to get so specific. After looking over material from 1st and 2nd year, I settled on the topic of gaming in educational settings. Below are my notes from this task:
		<br>
		<br><i>Why video games are essential in improving student engagement in educational settings</i><br>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Who would benefit from engaging with this topic?</b></li>
		<dd>- Teachers and educators so they can improve/implement new teaching methods</dd>
		<dd>- Parents, who may have assumptions about video games that relate to stereotypes</dd>
		<li><b>Are the envisioned audience acquainted with some aspects of the topic?</b></li>
		<dd>- Yes, the use of digital resources is encouraged in the Scottish education system by the Scottish Government.</dd>
		<li><b>Will you have to persuade them that this is worth learning?</b></li>
		<dd>- Initially maybe, depending on the person. I feel that older teachers may not be as open to this as younger ones, however that could be a stereotype that I am feeding into about older people being resistant to technology.</dd>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Task 2</h3>
		<h4>My Search Strategy</h4>
		<p>My first source was Google Scholar during my research. I started with a basic search of 'video games used in education', and 'digital resources in education'. The next refinment was '"video games" "student engagement" "education".
		</p>
		<h3>Task 3</h3>
		<p>Sources are organised:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Within a file on OneDrive</li>
			<li>Explained within an excel sheet <a href="nicole-source-table.xlsx" target=_blank">Nicole Source Table document</a></li>
