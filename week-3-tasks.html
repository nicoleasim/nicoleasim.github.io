		Task 1: Identifying a Narrative
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<b>What do I want the audience to take away from my website?<br></b>
		<li>I want my audience to feel a genuine want to implement this into their teaching.</li>
		<li>I don't want my audience to feel any critcism towards them if they are not already making use of digital games for teaching.</li><br>
		<b>What will the website help them do?</b>
		<li>The website will give them a new way of teaching, which could be helpful in certain topics/situations.</li>
		<br>
		<b>What are the audience interested in?</b>
		<li>The audience are interested in learning skills, as teachers they will always be looking for new ways to engage with students, particularly as every student is different and may require something different.</li>
		<br>
		<b>How will their interests impact how I structure the website design?</b>
		<li>Teachers tend to be organized people, and so an organized and well thought out design will be needed.</li>
		<br>
		<b>What do I need to remember about my audience?</b>
		<li>Teachers often manage a small budget, they may not be able to have access to all resources I need e.g. individual iPads for students.</li>
		<li>Remember what they do typically have access to – computer, smart boards that allow for interactive activities in the classroom.</li>
		<li>Perhaps aim towards head teachers/head of departments as they typically have the final say in where money goes.</li>
		</ul>

		Task 2: Story Board
		</h3>
		<p>I want to develop a story board showing the evolution of teachers implementing video games in to their learning. A website where you can scroll down and the page follows, explaining the benefits to teachers to grab their attention and to keep them scrolling. I am using my persona, 'Sophie', and imagining her story board.</p>
		<ul>
		<b>A.</b><br>
		<li>Sophie is a newly qualified teacher. She is researching online for resources for her new class, as she is struggling to get some students to engage with history topics. She found our website, which reminded her of using video games in the classroom, something she had briefly gone over at university.</li>
		<br>
		<b>B.</b>
		<li>She researches and discusses with her school the information she has found, the data it includes, and how it could benefit her class. She finds a nearby facility that performs educational VR workshops. As VR has been found to be beneficial in supporting learning, she discusses this opportunity with her school to see if it is something they can get involved in.</li>
		<br>
		<b>C.</b>
		<li>Her P5 class can take part in a VR workshop related to the history topic they are learning. After this workshop, Sophie finds that her students are much more engaged for the rest of the topic. Other classes who also took part in the workshops are also finding higher levels of student engagement.</li>
		<br>
		<b>D.</b>
		<li>Sophie continues to use the website as a resource for digital games and ideas on how to improve engagement. She makes use of the games that are on the website within class too. She has found a way to spark her classes interest and motivate their learning.</li>

            <p>
                A study from the University of St Andrews on the experiences of first year secondary pupils using virtual reality, reported 94% of the words used to describe the experience were categorised as 'positive'. This suggests a positive learning experience for users.
