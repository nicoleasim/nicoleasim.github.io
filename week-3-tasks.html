		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<ul>
		<b>What do I want the audience to take away from my website?<br></b>
		<li>I want my audience to feel a genuine want to implement this into their teaching.</li>
		<li>I don't want my audience to feel any critcism towards them if they are not already making use of digital games for teaching.</li><br>
		<b>What will the website help them do?</b>
		<li>The website will give them a new way of teaching, which could be helpful in certain topics/situations.</li>
		<br>
		<b>What are the audience interested in?</b>
		<li>The audience are interested in learning skills, as teachers they will always be looking for new ways to engage with students, particularly as every student is different and may require something different.</li>
		<br>
		<b>How will their interests impact how I structure the website design?</b>
		<li>Teachers tend to be organized people, and so an organized and well thought out design will be needed.</li>
		<br>
		<b>What do I need to remember about my audience?</b>
		<li>Teachers often manage a small budget, they may not be able to have access to all resources I need e.g. individual iPads for students.</li>
		<li>Remember what they do typically have access to â€“ computer, smart boards that allow for interactive activities in the classroom.</li>
		<li>Perhaps aim towards head teachers/head of departments as they typically have the final say in where money goes.</li>
